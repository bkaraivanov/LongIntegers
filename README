The Long Integers library implements arbitrarily long integers with support for
I/O and the basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication,
positive integer power, and integer division (quotient and remainder). It is 
minimalist by design for it was written just to cover the needs of a particular
computational problem I had to solve. The library proved useful also in testing
several number-theoretic hypotheses well beyond the limits of the built-in 
integers. Currently, there are no plans to add more functionality to the 
library since several excellent libraries implementing multiple precision 
arithmetic already exist (e.g., GMP). In comparison to them, Long Integers's 
only advantage is being small and manageable. Besides making it work correctly,
the main consideration in the design and implementation of the library was 
making it intuitive and easy to modify. Efficiency was only second.

The library is written in C++ using STL. It is provided as open source under 
the LGPL v.3 license.
